## Personal Finance Tracker (GitHub)

A full-stack web application designed to provide users with a comprehensive and intuitive tool for managing their personal finances. The project was conceived to practice and demonstrate end-to-end application development, from database design to frontend deployment. The backend is a lightweight yet powerful RESTful API built with Python and Flask, handling user authentication, data processing, and business logic. For the frontend, I used React with React Hooks for state management to create a dynamic and responsive single-page application (SPA). Data visualization is a core feature, implemented with Chart.js to generate interactive charts and graphs, helping users to easily understand their spending habits and financial health over time. The application is fully containerized using Docker for consistent development and deployment environments and is deployed on Heroku with a CI/CD pipeline configured through GitHub Actions.

## Home Automation System (GitHub)

This project is a custom home automation hub running on a Raspberry Pi, created to centralize control of various smart home devices from different manufacturers. The core of the system is a Python application that uses the Flask framework to serve both a simple web-based user interface and a REST API. This API allows for programmatic control of connected devices, enabling integration with third-party services like IFTTT or custom mobile applications. The system interfaces with devices such as Philips Hue lights and smart thermostats by communicating directly with their respective APIs over the local network. Key features include a scheduling engine for automating routines (e.g., turning lights on at sunset) and a rule-based system for creating custom event-driven automations. This project was an excellent exercise in working with hardware, managing system-level processes on Linux, and building a reliable, always-on service.
